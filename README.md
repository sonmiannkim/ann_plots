# Plotly and Belly Button Biodiversity From Bacteria to Beef

## Overview of the Belly Button Biodiversity
**The project was created to gather the information from the JSON data file, process it, 
and display the result on the web page.  To do so, we adopted JavaScript (ES6), Plotly, CSS, and HTML, Gave options to the users to filter the data as they wished.**

## Overview of the analysis:
Roza, a Biological researcher, is interested in protein synthesis, which represents the major route of disposal of amino acids like beef. Rosa is curious if there 
is a microorganism close to us growing in us that might supply the next best taste, and she wants to study in our belly and see if there is any organism like what 
she thinks it can be. To test her hypothesis, she gathers samples and wants to describe what results in she gets from them. Hereâ€™s some representation of her results.  


## Summary:
Using Plotly, JS and JSON, the plots were more informative and easily accessible to the user.
